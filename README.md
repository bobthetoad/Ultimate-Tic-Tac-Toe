# Running Instructions
Unfortunatley, this code was designed more or less to be shown off in an IDE, so there is no exectutable.
You're going to want one of you want to be able to run this.

1. Make sure all classes are in their respective places (This is easy if you download the `.zip`).
2. Open `game.ut3.ut3Runner.java` and run it from within the IDE.
3. Play the game! Invite a friend! Have a tournament!
4. Finish the game.
