Running Instructions
--------------------

1. Make sure all classes are in their respective classes (This is easy *if* you downloaded the `.zip`).
2. Open `game.ut3.ut3Runner.java` and run it.
3. Play the game, unless you don't want to for some reason. If you don't want to play the game and are reading this, maybe you can get you priorities straight. *Just saying* ...
4. Finish the game and actually do something productive.
